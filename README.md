# Data Structures with Python Tkinter Animation

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures along with Tkinter-based animations for visualization. The implemented data structures include:

- **Array**: A linear data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.
- **Graph**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.
- **LinkedList**: A linear collection of data elements, where each element points to the next one in the sequence.
- **Queue**: A collection of elements that supports adding elements at the end and removing elements from the front.
- **Stack**: A collection of elements with two main operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element.
- **Tree**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node has a parent and zero or more children.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-with-tkinter-animation.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd data-structures-with-tkinter-animation
    ```

## Usage

Each data structure implementation is contained within its own Python script file. To run the animations, simply execute the respective Python script.

For example, to run the animation for the array data structure, execute:

```bash
python array_animation.py
