### 1. Array

An array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.

### 2. Graph

A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect them.

### 3. LinkedList

A linked list is a linear collection of elements where each element points to the next one in the sequence.

### 4. Queue

A queue is a collection of elements that supports adding elements at the end (enqueue) and removing elements from the front (dequeue).

### 5. Stack

A stack is a collection of elements that supports adding elements to the top (push) and removing elements from the top (pop).

### 6. Sort

Sorting algorithms are methods of arranging items in a list in a specific order.
